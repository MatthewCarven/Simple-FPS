## 2026-11-06: planning

Planned the game with Matthew over three rounds of questions. Decisions are in PLAN.md.

Read every `.bsp` header and entity lump in `maps/` while content was still being copied in.
Matthew expected a mix of games, but it's 363 Quake 2 (IBSP 38) and one Quake 1 (`rene40q1.bsp`).
`q3dm7.bsp` is a Quake 2 format map by Gokart despite its name, so names can't be trusted and the
header is what counts.

Eight maps carry the titles of the original Quake 2 levels (`q2dm1` to `q2dm8`), and `maps/` holds many
edits of The Edge as well. Those stay out of the test and tuning set.

The texture check isn't meaningful yet. On the first pass `textures/` was flat and only 5% of references
resolved. 265 subfolders appeared after that, so the copy was still running. 512 bare texture names are
shared by more than one folder (`e2u1/metal37_2` and `e2u2/metal37_2`), so the folder structure has to be
kept. Matching on bare names would pick the wrong one.

No palette for `.wal` files found yet.

Nothing built. No repo yet, waiting on Matthew's `git init`.
